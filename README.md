# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning techniques. By employing models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, we aim to identify key factors influencing customer retention and provide actionable insights for retention strategies. The project utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret model predictions and highlight significant features affecting churn.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the environment for this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- shap

You can install the required packages using pip. If you don't have `pip` installed, you can follow the [official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-churn-analysis.git
   cd customer-churn-analysis
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn shap
Usage
Data Preparation: The dataset customer_churn_telecom.csv is included in the data directory. Ensure the file path is correct in the code.

Run the Analysis:

Open the Jupyter Notebook churn_analysis.ipynb or run the Python script churn_analysis.py to execute the analysis.
The script trains two machine learning models and evaluates their performance.
SHAP values are calculated and visualized to explain model predictions.
Results: After running the analysis, you will see model performance metrics and SHAP value visualizations.

The SHAP summary plot highlights which features are most influential in predicting customer churn.
